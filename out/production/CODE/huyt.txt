Anu was a girl with a natural talent for science. Her parents and teachers recognized Anu's
 potential and encouraged Anu to pursue a career in science. However, Anu had a problem. Anu was 
 very fickle-minded and had trouble focusing on one thing for too long. Anu would start a 
 project with great enthusiasm, only to lose interest halfway through and move on to something 
 else. Anu's grades started to slip, and Anu's parents became worried. They tried everything 
 they could think of to help Anu focus, but Anu couldn't seem to stick with anything for very 
 long.
